# medical-rag-pipeline
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for medical datasets and healthcare knowledge tasks.

Medical-RAG-Pipeline is a project that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow specialized for medical datasets. It combines efficient document retrieval with transformer-based text generation models to support accurate, evidence-backed responses for clinical, biomedical, and healthcare research tasks.

Built with popular open-source libraries including Hugging Face Transformers, FAISS, SciSpacy, and LangChain.

Supports customization for different datasets and healthcare domains.
##  Features

- Ingests and indexes medical datasets.
- Performs semantic search across documents.
- Integrates retrieval-augmented text generation.
- Easy to customize for different datasets and healthcare domains.
